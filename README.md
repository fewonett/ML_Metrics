### ML in Econometrics
This repository displays my submission for the course ML in Econometrics.  
The project displays the ability to prepare and transform raw data, an in depth understanding of econometric theory, the application of ML techniques for dimension reduction (Double Lasso/ Logit DL) and
identification of heterogenous treatment effects (Generalized Random Forests framework), as well as the ability to visualize statistical relations in easily 
understandable graphs. 
The following files are contained:
- ```instructions.pdf```: Outlining the task
- ```report.pdf ```: The final report describing results and methodology
- ```code/genderinequality.csv```: The dataset to be analyzed
- ```code/ML_CODE_FNETT.R```: The code implementing the analysis. All results and graphs used in report.pdf are produced here. To replicate update the working directory and leave the folder structure intact.
